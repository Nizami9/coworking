The space is located on Maybachufer, home to the twice-weekly Turkish Market (12 avocados for €2, y’all!) and within walking distance to prominent networking and event spaces. We have everything you need to be productive, including stable high-speed internet, free printing and all the coffee you can handle. The space features a shared kitchen (including a stove and dishwasher), call room, meeting room and two bathrooms, one of which has a shower (no need, then, to worry about your uncomfortably humid bike commute).",

Open 24/7 throughout the whole year, they simply do not have a restrictive opening or closing time. They believe that people do work differently than others and that’s okay. Whatever gets the work done! One can say that the Weserland space is an enchanted one. The moment you set in, there’s paper crane mobiles adorned on the ceilings in a spacious and cozy workspace. White walls, wooden floorings and a whole lot of natural daylight gives a sense of breathability and life into the space.",
